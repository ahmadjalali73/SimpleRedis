# SimpleRedis
it's a simple Redis database with c++

this project's purpose is for training C++
this is based on "build your own Redis with c\c++" book. the link to this book is this:
https://build-your-own.org/

I'm using codes of this book. there are only some minor changes in codes. but the real base is on this book.

cuation: I'm still writing these codes. hence, maybe there are some times that my code has some problems.
